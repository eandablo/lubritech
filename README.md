The header contains the simple logo of the company and links to the three different pages. Immediately below we find the hero-image with a small message to reiterate the purpose of the website. Following, the mission of the company is described in a section including a video. The next section is dedicated to the applications the company especialises on. To present the company reliability, a final section is added with feedback from other fictituous companies that have used the services of TRIBOPLEX in the past.

### Applications page design

The applications page keeps the header and hero image from the home page. This keeps users focus on the company professional aim. The applications is then divided into two sections presenting two very different aims. The first, mechanically demanding applications and second, biocompatible applications. These two completely different industriy examples will allow users to understand the flexibility of the company to provide solutions to opposite extreme sectors. The footer is kept from the home page.

The queries page is designed to allow users to ask for information about their especific problem and provide all the informatio needed for the company to contact them back.

# Website surface

The font Robot Slab was chosen for headers level from 1 to 4 and all paragraphs were given the font Signika. Besides their professional look this fonts allow easy readibility. The contrast between font color (#1b1b1b) and background (white) was chosen to ensure compliance with the WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast and allowing also a professional look scoring a value of 17.2 in the contrast grid (https://contrast-grid-eightshapes.com).

### Home page

The header contains the Logo of TRIBOPLEX and the main navigation menu floated at left and right, respectively. The header was given the property of sticky enhencing accesibility to other pages of the website at any point.
The hero image conveys the basic idea of lubrication and sets the mission of the TRIBOPLEX.
The text inside the hero image was colored in white since this allows a great contrast with the dark theme of the image without the need of a background banner.

The mission of TRIBOPLEX is explained in the section with header "meeting your lubrication needs". This section intends to explain the users the advantages of using the services of TRIBOPLEX and how different this company maybe from the competitors if compared. A video is provided to give additional information to non-experts users about the differences in lubricants. The video was obtained from the channel Engineering Materials-Tribology-Design.

This simple section invites the user to learn more by visiting the applications page providing an additional direct link at the bottom of this section.

### Applications page

The applications page keeps the header and hero image from the home page. The only change is the text in the hero image that remarks the intention of this page, telling the users the many ways TRIBOPLEX ca help.

![applications-hero](assets/images/readme-app-hero.png)

The first section is dedicated to highlu demanding mechaical applications which is divided in three columns. Righ and left columns give a brief description of the quelities desirable for lubricant working under these conditions. The central image of a gear box help the user to focus immediately in the context of the section.

The second section is dedicated to biological applications also with three columns. In this case, left and right abouts show images with simple examples of food and cosmetic industries helping the user to focus on the section subject. The text is concise explaining why lubrication is an important consideration in both applications.

The form is divided in two columns still following an industry standard order for the fields. On hovering the border of the fields become blue and on focus the background turns to a pinkish color wich in combination with the dark font color allows a contrast compliant with industry standards as evident on the 8.7 score in the contrast grid (https://contrast-grid-eightshapes.com).
